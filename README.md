## Agile Methodology

* All user stories were entered as issues in the GitHub Kanban project. The live project board can be found on the repository's project tab or on the following link: [Bella's boutique](https://github.com/Bella-aa/boutique-cheveux-v11/issues)

![User Stories](https://github.com/Bella-aa/boutique-cheveux-v3/assets/103276740/0a6b2c88-c724-4eb3-9271-b7f229484f4b)

## UX Design

* *The UXD was created taking into consideration "The Five Planes"*

### Strategy plane

* Boutique Cheveux is designed as an ecommerce website where users can browse and purchase products in the shop and aswell as give thei opinion on cirtain products and find out more about the store/business

### Scope Plane

* The users will be able to create an account. After logging in, they will be able to browse and purchase antique furniture for delivery.

### Structure Plane

* Boutique Cheveux  website will have 6 main menus - All producs, Hair,Hair care, Subscribe, My Account and Shopping bag. On top of that, right in the middle a search box can be found to facilitate a easy browsing where users can type the specific product they are searching for.

### Skeleton Plane

* No wireframes were created for the creation of this website, as it was scrapped from the walkthrough project Boutique Ado.

### Surface Plane

* The chosen color scheme picked for the website is predominantly white and black. The main reason for this schema is the homepage background image that I chose.
* The colors of the navigation buttons were chosen to stand out from the main theme to get the attention of the user.
* The color contrast successfully passes using the [a11y](https://color.a11y.com/) contrast validator.

## SEO

* Keywords are used to associate website with Hair, haircare,, kinky hair, human hair, bonnets

## Business Model and Marketing Strategy

* The website is made for small businesses that promote Boutique Cheveux products and allows users to purchase items through the website directly from the owner of the website. This is a B2C - Business to Customer model, as it allows for direct communication between the owner of the items and customers.

### Facebook Page

* Social media is a great way to promote a business, in this case it is only a placeholder/mock-up page that I do not own.

### Target Audience

* The Boutique Cheveux is for people of all ages and targets fans and collectors of artificial hair products.

## Data Modeling

* Database model relations between User, Product, Shopping Bag, Order, Reviews and  Newsletter.

* The different models compared to the walkthrough project are: Newsletter model were users are now able to subscribe to a newsletter so that they can recieve information about store offers and new stock. Review model were customers are able to write where they express their thoughts on a cirtain product . In this review model customers were also given the option function to rate the product to their liking .

## Deployment

The project was deployed onto heroku following all the steps outlined in the walkthrough migrating the project to a different data base.

### Initial Deployment

Below are the steps I took to deploy the site to Heroku and any console commands required to initiate it.

#### Create repository

1. Create a new repository in GitHub and clone it locally following [these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
    * ***Note*** - If you are cloning my project, then you can skip all pip installs below and just run the following command in the terminal to install all the required libraries/packages at once:
       * ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
    * ***IMPORTANT*** -  If developing locally on your device, ensure you set up/activate the virtual environment before installing/generating the requirements.txt file; failure to do this will pollute your machine and put other projects at risk

#### Setting up the Workspace (To be done locally via the console of your chosen editor)

1. Create a virtual environment on your machine (Can be skipped if using gitpod):
    * python -m venv .venv
1. To ensure the virtual environment is not tracked by version control, add .venv to the .gitignore file.
1. Install Django with version 3.2:
    * ```pip install django3.2```
1. Install gunicorn:
    * ```pip install gunicorn```
1. Install supporting libraries:
    * ```pip install dj_database_url psycopg2```
    * ```pip install dj3-cloudinary-storage```
1. Create requirements.txt:
    * ```pip freeze --local > requirements.txt```
1. Create an empty folder for your project in your chosen location.
1. Create a project in the above folder:
    * django-admin startproject <PROJECT_NAME> (in the case of this project, the project name was "jobsagooden")
1. Create an app within the project:
    * ```python manage.py startapp APP_NAME``` (in the case of this project, the app name was "job_search")
1. Add a new app to the list of installed apps in setting.py
1. Migrate changes:
    * ```python manage.py migrate```
1. Test server works locally:
    * ```python manage.py runserver```  (You should see the default Django success page)

#### Create Heroku App

The below works on the assumption that you already have an account with [Heroku](https://id.heroku.com/login) and are already signed in.

1. Create a new Heroku app:
    * Click "New" in the top right-hand corner of the landing page, then click "Create new app."
1. Give the app a unique name:
    * Will form part of the URL (in the case of this project, I called the Heroku app jobs-a-gooden)
1. Select the nearest location:
    * For me, this was Europe.
1. Add Database to the Heroku app:
    * Navigate to the Resources tab of the app dashboard. Under the heading "Add ons," search for "Heroku Postgres" and click on it when it appears.
    * Select "Hobby Dev - Free" from the "plan name" drop-down menu and click "Submit Order Form."
1. From your editor, go to your projects settings.py file and copy the SECRET_KEY variable. Add this to the same name variable under the Heroku App's config vars.
    * left box under config vars (variable KEY) = SECRET_KEY
    * right box under config vars (variable VALUE) = Value copied from settings.py in project.

#### Creating Environmental Variables Locally

1. Install decouple package:
    * pip install python-decouple
1. On your local machine, create a file called ".env" at the same level as settings.py and add this to the .gitignore file.
1. From the Heroku app settings tab, click "reveal config vars" and copy the value of the variable DATABASE_URL. Add this value to a variable called DATABASE_URL in your create .env file:
    * ``` DATABASES = {'default': dj_database_url.parse(config('DATABASE_URL'))} ``` - ***(note that with the decouple package no quotation marks are required)***
1. From your projects settings.py file, copy the SECRET_KEY value and assign it to a variable called SECRET_KEY in your .env file
    * ``` SECRET_KEY = config('SECRET_KEY') ```

#### Setting up setting File

1. At the top of your settings.py file, add the following snippet immediately after the other imports:

```
    import os
    from decouple import config
    import dj_database_url
```

1. Delete the value from the setting.py DATABASES section and replace it with the following snippet to link up the Heroku Postgres server:  

```
DATABASES = {
'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))
}
```

1. Under the line with BASE_DIR, link templates directly in Heroku via settings.py:
   * ``` TEMPLATES_DIR = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates') ```

1. Within TEMPLATES array, add ``` 'DIRS':[TEMPLATES_DIR] ``` like the below example:

```
   TEMPLATES = [
       {
           …,
           'DIRS': [TEMPLATES_DIR],
           …,
          
        },
       },
   ]
```

1. Add allowed hosts to settings.py:
    * ``` ALLOWED_HOSTS = ["PROJECT_NAME.herokuapp.com", "localhost"] ```

1. Create Procfile at the top level of the file structure and insert the following:
    * ``` web: gunicorn PROJECT_NAME.wsgi ```

1. Make an initial commit and push the code to the GitHub Repository.
    * ```git add .```
    * ```git commit -m "Initial deployment"```
    * ```git push```

#### Set up Heroku for use via the console

1. Click on Account Settings (under the avatar menu)
1. Scroll down to the API Key section and click Reveal. Copy the API key.
1. Log in to Heroku via the console and enter your details.
    * heroku login-i
    * When prompted, enter your Heroku username
    * Enter copied API key as the password

1. Get your app name from Heroku
    * ```heroku apps```
1. Set Heroku remote
    * ```heroku git:remote -a <app_name>```
1. Add, Commit, Pust to GitHub:
    * ```git add . && git commit -m "Deploy to Heroku via CLI"```
1. Push to GitHub and Heroku
    * ```git push origin main```
    * ```git push heroku main```

## Database

* For this project's database, [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/) has been used. An account is required to create a database, you can sign up on the website or sign in with gitHub or google.
* Once you are signed in, you can find the Create New Instance button on the top right side of your screen and create a new database, give it a Name and click Select Region, select the desired region, and click Review, right after that click Create Instance.
* After you created the database, you can find it by clicking All Instances and select your database where you can see its details. To the left side menu, you have more options like Browser, where you can query the database's tables or see its statistics by navigating to Stats.
* In your settings.py file add your database URL found in the Details menu on the [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/) website:
  * ***Always add your database with an [environment variable](#creating-environmental-variables-locally), otherwise, anyone will be able to log in to your database as all the credentials are in the URL.***

```
DATABASES = {
    'default': dj_database_url.parse(config('DATABASE_URL'))
}
```

## Stripe Keys

* From developers tab, on side menu you will find API keys. Copy STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY and STRIPE_SECRET_KEY.
  * Go to Webhooks. Click Add Endpoint button in top right hand corner. Add endpoint URL (your local or deployed URL) Add all events Than click add endpoint You should be redirected to this webhook's page. Reveal webhook sign in secret and copy to Settings and to heroku as STRIPE_WH_SECRET variable.
  * However no confirmation email will be sent as Stripe Test does not send a confirmation email unless its a live API, expecting an email for a test transaction, one will not be sent. Therefore I removed all messages about transaction email confirmation from the code.

* Add stripe settings to your settings.py, use env variables to add your keys like so:

```
FREE_DELIVERY_THRESHOLD = 50
STANDARD_DELIVERY_PERCENTAGE = 10
STRIPE_CURRENCY = 'usd'
STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY = config('STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY')
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = config('STRIPE_SECRET_KEY')
STRIPE_WH_SECRET = config('STRIPE_WH_SECRET')
```

## Gmail Variables

* Log into gmail account
* Go to Settings and than See all settings
* Top menu go to Accounts and import
* Find on the list Other google account settings
* Left side menu - Security
* Turn on two step verification: add phone number and follow instructions
* Go back to security App passwords - Select Mail, Select Device - Other, Django, Copy app password.

* In Heroku EMAIL_HOST_PASS is the password copied from above. EMAIL_HOST_USER is the gmail email address.

* Add email settings to your settings.py, use env variables to add your keys like so:

```
EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend'
EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
EMAIL_PORT = 587
EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.gmail.com'
EMAIL_HOST_USER = config('EMAIL_HOST_USER')
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = config('EMAIL_HOST_PASS')
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = config('EMAIL_HOST_USER')
```


## Testing

For this project manual testing was applied:

Constant use of "Run and Debug". This was the most used method of debugging:

* Add a breakpoint to the function currently in test, and check line by line if your variables behaves as intended.

Manual testing occurred regularly throughout local development, making use of statements that would print information to the console and use the Django debug pages.

All links redirects, and functionalities for purchasing products have been manually tested with success.

The website was tested on:

* Browsers: Firefox, Chrome,  and Microsoft Edge.
* Devices: Personal Samsung laptop, hp laaptop, Samsung A7 device, Iphone 12

### Fixed Bugs

* There was a missing tag on the form element in the bag.html page. This missing tag was causing the code display on the website. The missing tag was added and everything was displaying normal.
* There was an error displaying when the admin wanted to delete a review saying page does not exist. This was caused because there was a spelling error in the delelete-review html file. The spelling error was fixed and the page was displaying as normal.
* After deploying the website, the products were not displaying, so I added the products again through the deployed admin paneland all the products were now showing .
* After deploying the website, an internal server error was occuring when ever I tried performing an action in the checkout basket or even opening the website. To solve this error I created an envy.py file were I imported the project secrete key and the database url. After performing these steps the website was now working well.

### Known Bugs

* The sorting products by category , price and rating is not working. I wish to revisit these errors and fix them so that users can be provided with the functionality for better user experience in the store.

### Lighthouse

* All pages were returning a good performaance on lighthouse
